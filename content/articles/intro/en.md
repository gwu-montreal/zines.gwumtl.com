### **_Dear Reader…_**

Welcome back to yet another rousing issue of the **Game Workers Unite Montréal(Collectif des travailleu·ses·rs de l’industrie du jeu) zine**. Before we jump into the thick of things, we thought we'd take a moment to look back on the events of the past year, both good and ill.

Happy 2025! To ring in the new year, we thought we'd recap some highlights from the 2024 union movement in games, as well as some of what GWU Montréal has been up to over the last year. 2024 was once again a terrible year for layoffs in the industry. We spoke to media outlets like CBC and [Le Devoir](https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/807864/monde-jeu-video-entre-licenciements-epuisements) about the impact of the layoffs and how workers can organize to fight back and build long-term protections for themselves and their coworkers.We offered support to workers who had been impacted, and also onboarded many new members. Our organization has grown and we've been supporting more workplace union campaigns than ever before!

In February 2024 Ubisoft workers organizing with STJV, Solidaires Informatique, and FIECI [launched a nationwide strike in France](https://x.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1753015863542788591) to protest the impasse in negotiations with Ubisoft management over salaries. Around 700 workers joined the strike!

In March, [workers at Activision QA voted to unionize with CODE CWA](https://www.polygon.com/24093254/activision-qa-600-workers-union-microsoft), forming one of the largest units to date in the US games industry with around 600 members! GWU Montréal also participated in the ["Change the Rules" panel](https://gdcvault.com/play/1034180/Change-the-Rules-Co-Ops) on worker coops and unions at GDC, presenting to a packed room and handing out hundreds of zines over the course of the conference.

Throughout 2024 workers at KWS Edmonton continued to strike against Keywords' union-busting, hosting [regular streams on Twitch](https://x.com/FP4GW/status/1773000929648005426). Our members joined them for a couple of conversations about the state of the industry, worker organizing, and more! This was also the year Sega of America workers (AEGIS) [won the first collective bargaining agreement at a major videogame company in the US](https://www.polygon.com/24113444/sega-america-workers-union-contract-aegis), with just-cause protections, raises, and more!

In May we announced [a collaboration with CSN](https://www.polygon.com/24145830/game-workers-unite-csn-union-2024), one of the largest union federations in Québec, in a push to establish a new province-wide union for game workers.

In June, July, and August [workers at Bethesda Game Studios Montréal unionized](https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639) alongside workers at Bethesda studios across the US, forming the first officially certified union in the Quebec games industry! Around the same time, [World of Warcraft workers in the US also won their union](https://x.com/WoWGG_CWA/status/1816194652539871269), while SAG-AFTRA videogame workers voted almost unanimously to authorize a strike for stronger AI protections.

In October and November, [Ubisoft and Don't Nod workers in France](https://www.stjv.fr/2024/11/mise-en-place-dune-caisse-de-greve-pour-le-mouvement-social-a-dont-nod/) and Zenimax workers in the US went on strike against forced return to office, unjust layoffs, bad-faith bargaining, and outsourcing.

Here in Montréal, we coordinated [a button-making party](https://x.com/GWU_Montreal/status/1848388021688713658), a Q&A with Bethesda organizers, and organizer trainings with the CSN. We also participated in a conference with game worker organizers from around the world! As part of the [campaign with CSN](https://sesyndiquer.org/jeux-video/), we also travelled to studios across Québec to talk to other workers about organizing at their workplace, set up info sessions on unions and labour law, and put them in touch with trained staff who could help support them.

And we haven't even mentioned all the unions that formed in Poland, Spain, Korea, and elsewhere! The movement to organize the games industry internationally is growing fast, and workers everywhere are standing up for their rights and claiming a seat at the table!

We have big plans for 2025, and will be organizing a number of trainings in the new year. If you'd like to get involved and learn how to organize at your workplace, [get in touch](https://gwumtl.com/fr/)!

Together, we have the capacity to build a better, fairer, and more sustainable future for workers all around the globe. If you're a worker in games, abuses like **mass layoffs**, **crunch**, and **harassment** might seem like unavoidable realities of the industry. But they don't have to be. Join us.
