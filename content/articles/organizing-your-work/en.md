title: "Strategy Guide: How to Start Organizing your Workplace"

Interested in organizing with your coworkers, but don't know where to start?
Here are six simple steps to get you on your way to forming a union! **Make sure
to keep discussions about the possibility of unionizing away from the ears of
employers, even if you think they're sympathetic to your cause.**

1. **Reach out to existing unions** and organizations in your area for help,
   advice, and solidarity. [Game Workers Unite
   chapters](https://www.gameworkersunite.org), related trade and industrial
   unions, and existing game worker unions internationally are all great
   resources for learning how to organize your own workplace, and establishing
   relationships now can strengthen both parties' actions in the future. **If
   possible, talk to experienced organizers or attend a training session on
   workplace organizing.**

2. **Talk to your coworkers** one-on-one about their problems in the workplace,
   away from the supervision of management. Ask questions, and let them tell you
   the things that they want to fix; listen carefully, and don't assume you know
   what their problems are. Be supportive and understanding, and help them
   realize they're not alone in these issues. **Don't start talking about unions
   yet!** Start by identifying problems to solve.

3. **Help them identify collective solutions** to the problems they've shared.
   Just talking about issues isn't enough; stopping there can build frustration
   and anger without being constructive with those feelings. Your goal is to
   guide your co-workers towards seeing collective action as a solution to their
   problems, by asking questions and listening to their answers. Open-ended
   questions like "Who else feels this way?" and "What would happen if…" are
   useful. **Always be honest!** Don't oversell what's possible, and don't
   minimize the potential dangers.

4. **Organize a first action** to solve a simple, achievable problem. You don't
   need the whole office on board! Start with 10% of your coworkers, and target
   something concrete and achievable: demanding free coffee, or complaining to
   the boss as a group. By winning these fights, you and your coworkers will see
   the power of collective action, gain courage and experience, and inspire
   others to join in the next action. **Before you take that first action,
   though…**

5. **Prepare your coworkers for the bosses' reaction** when they find out you're
   organizing. Bosses have a lot of tactics to break up organizing workers, and
   they can be very effective and intimidating to the unprepared, but they're
   also very predictable. Learn these tactics yourself, and share them with your
   coworkers. These plays are much less effective when people know they're
   coming, and you've already had a chance to counter their anti-union lines.

6. **Push your coworkers to become organizers themselves**. You can't do
   everything yourself, so help your coworkers become more involved by giving
   them tasks and following up. A task can be anything from taking notes at a
   meeting, to designing and printing flyers, to bringing in new members
   themselves. Don't forget to set deadlines and follow up on these tasks; this
   is real and important work, and doing it is empowering. Eventually, your
   coworkers will be suggesting their own tasks and managing themselves!

**Only go public when you're confident you have the backing of the majority of
your workforce** and you have a concrete plan that everyone has agreed upon.
People are routinely fired for trying to unionize, so make sure to protect your
privacy, and the privacy of your fellow workers. In most countries a worker's
right to unionize is protected under law, so make sure to inform yourself on
what your rights are (local unions can help with this).
