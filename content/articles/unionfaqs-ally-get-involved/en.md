Even if you don't work in the game industry yourself, there are still lots of
other ways you can support organizing efforts:

1. **Help unionize your own industry, or get involved in your own union**! The
   more workers that are organized, the more potential there is for
   cross-industry solidarity and mutual aid. And the more unionization gains
   momentum across industries, the more it becomes a logical path for
   unorganized sectors.

2. **Talk to players about why unions are important** and how they can address
   problems that affect both workers and consumers. Remind them that the
   conditions and pressures that result in compromised games (or abusive
   mechanics like loot boxes) aren't the choice of the workers — we hate that
   stuff too and we want to make the best games possible! — but the result of
   bosses' decisions.

3. **Signal boost workers in the industry** who speak out about working
   conditions. If you're a streamer, a writer, or someone who makes videos, talk
   about these issues in the work you produce. (There's lots of different
   avenues to explore, too — we'd love to see a broader historical perspective
   on how labour issues have been part of games since the beginning.)

4. **[Join Game Workers Unite](https://www.gameworkersunite.org/get-involved)
   and get involved** in on-the-ground organizing efforts! We actively encourage
   players, academics, and anyone who wants to improve conditions in the
   industry to engage in the community and help us succeed.
