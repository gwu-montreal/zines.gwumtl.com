If you are a business owner who wants to be an ally to workers and to support
them in their efforts to build a better industry, there's an ideal way for you
to do just that! Transforming the ownership structure of your company and
transitioning to a workers' cooperative abolishes the fundamental conflicts and
relationships of inequality that are built into any company with employees. See
the section on co-ops later in this zine for info!
